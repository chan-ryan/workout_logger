# Workout Logger

This is a mobile app for iOS and Android to log and view workouts. It is built using Flutter for the frontend/UI and Firebase for the backend/database. 

Currently supports features such as adding and deleting workouts, which contain information about the activity done, the time it took place, and an optional description. Workouts are sorted by month and year, which users can scroll through. The app also allows users to register and sign in using an email and password, which utilizes Firebase's authentication services.
